One of the main companies that interested me was Uber technologies. The technologies they use consist of node.js, react, java, mysql, mongo DB, Python,  and Swift just to name a few. They used these tech stacks because of the usability of the cross compatibility between different user interfaces a platforms. The second company is Airbnb, and the technologies they use is JavaScript, React, MySql, AWS, Ruby, Rails, and SASS. The third company is Spotify. The technologies they utilize is Python, Java, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap,  and Google Cloud.
